cif2ps Release notes
22 April 2010 David_Harris@hmc.edu

You are free to modify and improve this code so long as you attribute the original source and make your improvements freely available.

To run:
Create a .cif file from Electric or Cadence
   Use the NCSU layer map (in the samples directory, or the NCSU PDK)
Customize the colors with a layermap.txt file in your local directory or 
  use the default one in /cad/cif2ps/layermap.txt
  (change C code and recompile to adjust this default location)
invoke with
   cif2ps filename.cif

Known limitations:

Transparency does not work with polygons.  The I/O pads from the University of Utah pad library have two large metal2 polygons partially covering the drivers, causing them to look a bit funny.

To recompile:
type "make"

Other Notes:

For CMOS VLSI Design illustrations, I want really sharp pictures with clean transparency and with outlines of each layer.  This can be done for small cells by:
      use cif2psc with -nt no transparency option
      open .ps in Illustrator
      ungroup everything
      Select a metal3 wire.  
         Use Select * Same Fill Color to select all.  
         Group.
         Set Transparency to 70%.
         Use Windows * Pathfinder * Merge to merge all rectangles on the layer (seems very slow for M2 on a TinyChip)
         Set the outline color to a darker shade and an appropriate stroke width
     Repeat for Metal2, Metal1, Poly
