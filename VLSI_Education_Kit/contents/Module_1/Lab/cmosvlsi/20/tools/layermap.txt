# CIF Layermap file
# Written 5/1/01 David_Harris@hmc.edu
#
# Format:
# Layer-name Opacity Foreground R G B Merge1 Merge2
#
# If Merge1 and Merge2 are given, Layer-name is generated every
# time layers with those two names overlap.  This is useful for
# defining P diffusion as the overlap of P-select and Active Area.
#
# Opacity indicates how much a layer should obscure lower levels.
# Set it to 1 if the layer should be opaque, or a fraction if lower
# levels should partially show through.  
#
# Foreground should be 1 if the layer should show up beneath partially
# transparent layers.  It is set to 0 for layers like wells and selects
# that should not show through.
#
# The R, G, and B coordinates are on a scale of 0 to 1 from dark to light.
# White layers (R=G=B=1) will not be visible.
#
# The layers later in the list are plotted on top of layers earlier in
# the list.
#
# The first layer should be called NULL.  It is used when an undefined
# CIF layer is requested, so it may be a bright color to flag the error.
